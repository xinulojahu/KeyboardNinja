You don't see many birds in winter. Most have left your area. Those that stay are not as active. Activity uses energy that is needed to keep warm. The worst problems for birds in winter are getting enough heat and holding on to the heat once it is made. These are problems for all birds. But it is especially true for very small ones. They cannot find enough food. The weather stays so cold for so long that they cannot eat enough to keep alive. But birds have many ways of fighting the cold.

I have become so full of knowledge that it is as if I have been living on trillions and trillions of billions of years, trillions of planets like this Earth, this world is absolutely clear to me, and I am looking for only one thing here - peace, tranquility and here is this harmony, from merging with the infinitely eternal, from contemplating the great fractal similarity, and from this wonderful unity of being, infinitely eternal, wherever you look, even in depth infinitely small, even up - infinite big, you know?

How many nostrils do you have? Four. Two you can see, two you can't. This discovery came from observing how fish breathe. Fish get their oxygen from water. Most of them have two pairs of nostrils, a forward-facing set for letting water in and a pair of "exhaust pipes" for letting it out again. The question is, if humans evolved from fishes, where did the other pair of nostrils go. The answer is that they migrated back inside the head to become internal.

The highest mountain is located on Mars. The giant volcano Mount Olympus is the highest mountain in the solar system and in the known universe. At 14 miles and 388 miles across, it is almost three times the height of Mount Everest and so wide that its base would cover Arizona, or the whole of the area of the British Isles. The crater on the top is around 45 miles wide and over nearly 2 miles deep, easily big enough to swallow London.

(Seneca); "I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals." (Sir Winston Churchill)

English is a great classic novel or an exciting thriller that you can't tear yourself away from. But it's also a grammar book that you sometimes want to throw against the wall! English is a very beautiful, expressive and incomprehensible language, in which many things do not lend themselves to reasonable explanation, and there are many exceptions to every rule. But this is what makes it so fascinating to study! You're just beginning to think that now you understand everything, when suddenly-a new nuance! But the comprehension of the new is a constant development.

The world is not white and fluffy. This is a very dangerous, violent place, and no matter how tough you are, it will knock you over so hard that you won't get up again. Neither you, nor I, nor anyone else in the world hits as hard as life. But it doesn't matter how you hit it. It is important how you hold the punch, how you move forward. How much you can move forward and how much you can stand. That's how they win... (Rocky)

I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor. Thats not my business. I dont want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black men, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others' happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. (The Great Dictator)

The truth is too much for you, son! We live in a world where the walls are guarded by people with military weapons. Who will do this? You? I have a responsibility that you could never have imagined. And my existence, so absurd and incomprehensible to you, saves lives! You don't need the truth! We use the words "honor", "code", "loyalty". We rely on these words, dedicating our lives to protecting others, and you use them as a joke. (A few good men)

Is French toast from France? Yes and no. Dipping bread in eggs and frying it is a pretty universal solution to making stale bread go further. The French certainly had a medieval version and this later became a name that has been enthusiastically adopted for the de luxe versions. The earliest recorded recipe for the dish occurs in the work of the Roman cook in the first century AD. In his book The Art of Cooking, he writes, rather casually, that it's just another sweet dish.

The truth gives you freedom! My client has been saddled more often than a horse at a race, but that doesn't matter. This section follows standard rules. She gets half of the joint estate or $11.395 million! Jordan makes the throw. And now - the ball is in the basket! That's all, your honor. (Liar, liar)

Only seven prisoners were freed by the storming of the Bastille. In France, 14 July, Bastille Day, is a national holiday and a glorious national symbol. From the rousing paintings of the scene, you might think hundreds of proud revolutionaries flooded into the streets waving tricolours. In fact, only just over half a dozen people were being held at the time of the siege.

Charles Darwin was driven by gastronomic, as well as scientific, curiosity and once ate an oil. While reading Divinity at Cambridge University, he became a member of the Glutton club which met once a week and actively sought to eat animals not normally found on menus. Darwin’s son commenting on his father's letters, noted that the Glutton club enjoyed, among other things, hawk and bittern.

As well as mercury, gallium and francium can all be liquids at room temperature. Gallium was discovered by French chemist in 1875. It was the first new element to confirm Dmitri Mendeleev's prediction of the periodic table. Gallium is used chiefly in microchips because of its strange electronic properties. Compact disc players also make use of it because when mixed with arsenic it transforms an electric current directly into laser light.

As a child, Kurt Cobain had an imaginary friend named Buddha. Buddha, according to the performer, was his own dark side. A suicide note was also dedicated to her. Until now, many researchers think that this letter was corrected after the death of the musician. The note was about Cobain's music, and only the last few lines were dedicated to Courtney Love and daughter Frances. However, the handwriting of the first part differs from that of the last.

Brian may said that there was an unwritten rule in the band: not to discuss the meaning of the song's lyrics with the author. Because there was something personal in the lyrics and it was considered indecent to go into them: the musicians believed that the author of the song knew what he was doing. So may never asked mercury what all those strange words in "Bohemian Rhapsody" meant. And only at the time of writing The Show Must Go On mercury sat down with may and the guitarist invited Freddie to participate in the creation of the text. According to may, they discussed "absolutely every word and what they wanted to say to them".

What does the Moon smell like? Like gunpowder, apparently. Only twelve people have walked on the moon, all of them American. Obviously, in their airtight space suits the astronauts could not actually smell the Moon, but moondust is clingy stuff, and plenty of it was traipsed back into the cabin when they returned from the Moon's surface. They reported that moondust feels like snow, smells like gunpowder, and doesn’t taste too bad.

How many planets are there in the solar system? Eight. If you still think there’s nine you've obviously been living in a parallel solar system. Planets must fulfil three criteria: they have to orbit the sun, have enough mass to be spherical, and to have cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Pluto only managed the first two, so was demoted to the status of dwarf planet.
